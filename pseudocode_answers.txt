> Why do programmers use pseudocode?
A: It's a logical way to break down algorithms into small pieces.

> If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A: It wouldn't run unless you write it in a programming language.

#### Programming Assignment

>Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

> Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A:
```
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
CALL the Math.max method with first and second number in parameters, and store the result in answer
RETURN answer
```

> Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A:
```
SET count to 0
INPUT a number
WHILE the number is less than 101
ADD number to total
INPUT a number
ENDWHILE
PRINT count
```

> Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

A:
```
SET phonebook to array of entries: john, 555-555-5555, 123 south street.
SET iteration to 0.
FOR an entry that is less than phonebook.length
INPUT iteration
ENDFOR
IF phonebook array is strictly equal to entry
PRINT "Found entry" + " " + "entry" + " " + "at index" + " " + iteration
RETURN true
END
RETURN FALSE
SET entry to findEntry name
IF not entry
PRINT "Entry does not exist!"
```

> Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A:
```var phonebook = ['john', '555-555-555', '123 south street'];

function findEntry(entry) {
  for (var i=0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
    if (phonebook[i] === entry) {
      console.log("Found entry" + " " + entry + " " + "at index" + " " + i);
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

var entry = findEntry('john');
if(!entry) {
  console.log('Entry does not exist!');
}
```
